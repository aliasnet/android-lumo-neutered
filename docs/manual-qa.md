# Manual QA Report: Billing Availability Scenarios

This report documents the four billing availability scenarios requested for the refactored billing gateway. Each scenario captures the intended setup, the expected application behavior derived from the production code, and the actual verification status in this environment.

| Scenario | Setup | Expected Behavior | Actual Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Device without Google Mobile Services (GMS)** | Launch the app on a device missing the Play Store and Billing libraries. | `BillingProvider` falls back to `NoopBillingGateway`, leaving `available=false`; the payment dialog renders `BillingUnavailableContent`, and WebView skips upgrade handler injections while keeping core navigation intact.【F:app/src/main/java/me/proton/android/lumo/billing/gateway/BillingProvider.kt†L18-L34】【F:app/src/main/java/me/proton/android/lumo/billing/gateway/NoopBillingGateway.kt†L9-L43】【F:app/src/main/java/me/proton/android/lumo/ui/components/PaymentDialog.kt†L452-L489】【F:app/src/main/java/me/proton/android/lumo/webview/WebViewScreen.kt†L331-L349】 | Not executed — no GMS-free emulator/device available in this container. |
| **2. Device with GMS installed but user not signed in** | Launch on stock Android with Play Store present but not authenticated. | Billing connects but Play responses such as `BILLING_UNAVAILABLE` surface via `markBillingUnavailable`, so the UI still deactivates upgrades and surfaces the generic “billing unavailable” messaging without crashing.【F:app/src/main/java/me/proton/android/lumo/billing/BillingManager.kt†L64-L130】【F:app/src/main/java/me/proton/android/lumo/billing/BillingManager.kt†L200-L276】 | Not executed — sign-out flow requires interactive device access. |
| **3. Device with GMS installed and user signed in** | Launch on a Play-enabled device with a valid Google account. | `BillingManager.establishConnection` reports `OK`, enabling subscriptions and upgrade handlers once `billingAvailable` becomes `true`, keeping dialogs interactive.【F:app/src/main/java/me/proton/android/lumo/billing/BillingManager.kt†L226-L271】【F:app/src/main/java/me/proton/android/lumo/ui/components/PaymentDialog.kt†L452-L513】【F:app/src/main/java/me/proton/android/lumo/MainActivity.kt†L357-L380】 | Not executed — no physical or virtual Play Store device connected. |
| **4. Device with Google hosts blocked (DNS firewall)** | Launch on a device that denies network access to `play.googleapis.com`. | The 2s timeout in `BillingProvider` returns the no-op gateway, so billing stays disabled while the web experience continues and the dialog shows the offline-friendly message.【F:app/src/main/java/me/proton/android/lumo/billing/gateway/BillingProvider.kt†L18-L34】【F:app/src/main/java/me/proton/android/lumo/ui/components/BillingUnavailableContent.kt†L1-L47】 | Not executed — network shaping not available in containerized environment. |

> **Note:** Manual verification could not be performed inside this headless container. The expectations above are validated by inspecting the Kotlin sources listed in the citations and by the new instrumentation coverage (`BillingUnavailablePaymentDialogTest` and `BillingUnavailableMainActivityTest`) that assert the toast and dialog copy when billing remains disabled.
