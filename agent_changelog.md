## Recent Update
- Audited the ladder plan for Turn 11 and captured the remaining validation gaps around billing-unavailable experiences, confirming coverage is limited to JVM tests because the container lacks an Android SDK.
- Prioritized instrumentation or detailed manual QA scripting as the next actionable path, documenting the dependency on an SDK-capable executor such as the existing GitHub Actions workflow.

## Outstanding Issues
- Instrumentation/UI tests are still missing for the billing-unavailable surfaces because the container lacks an Android SDK; CI covers JVM, but device-parity remains manual.
- Gradle assemble, targeted unit tests, and lint still fail locally for the same SDK-location reason noted in previous turns, so verification depends on external environments.
- Manual QA steps are not yet recorded for teams validating on physical devices or emulators when instrumentation cannot run.

## Suggested Next Task (Turn 12)
- Author a minimal instrumentation suite under `app/src/androidTest` (Compose UI or Espresso) that forces the no-op billing gateway and asserts the shared toast/dialog copy, running it on the GitHub Actions workflow or another SDK-equipped environment.
- If instrumentation cannot be delivered immediately, draft a comprehensive manual QA checklist (devices, OS versions, expected UI) so billing-unavailable behavior can be verified externally, and ensure the checklist is linked from project docs.

## Upcoming Task (Turn 13)
- Integrate results from instrumentation/manual QA into documentation, capture evidence (logs/screenshots) for future regressions, and schedule localization/accessibility follow-ups identified during Turn 12 validation.
